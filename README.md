# SOLIDITY
Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.
The Solidity programming language is an open source, community project governed by a core team.

## DESCRIPTION
This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
The solidity contract has function that returns the string public tokenName = "Swechchha";string public tokenAbbry = "MTA"; uint public totalSupply = 0;
This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

### GETTING STARTED

#### EXECUTING PROGRAM
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension). Copy and paste the following code into the file:
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile" button.
Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Solidity" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
Once the contract is deployed, Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the message.
